# RSA Implementation in Python

This is a simple implementation of the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) encryption and decryption algorithm in Python.

## Overview

RSA is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. It uses asymmetric key encryption, meaning that there are two keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The security of RSA relies on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, the "factoring problem."

## Features

- Generate RSA key pair: This implementation allows you to generate an RSA public/private key pair.
- Encrypt and Decrypt messages: You can use the generated keys to encrypt and decrypt messages securely.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install required packages:
- gympy2
